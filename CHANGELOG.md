- Type safety improvements across countdown components with proper TypeScript definitions
- Audio duration edge cases: Handles failed audio duration calculation gracefully with fallback to transcription length

### Technical Improvements

- **Audio Duration Tracking Data Flow**:
  1. Recording completes → Calculate duration via Web Audio API
  2. Store in session state (`audioDuration` field added to `PatientSession`)
  3. Persist to `chrome.storage.local` (added to `PersistedSession`)
  4. Pass through display state (`displayAudioDuration` in useAppState)
  5. Flow to UnifiedPipelineProgress → ProcessingTimePredictor
  6. Use for ETA calculation and historical learning

- **State Management Enhancements**:
  - Added `audioDuration` to `PatientSession`, `PersistedSession`, and `DisplaySessionState` types
  - Updated `SET_DISPLAY_SESSION` and `CLEAR_DISPLAY_SESSION` reducers in useAppState
  - Modified `getCurrentDisplayData()` to include audio duration in all branches
  - Pass-through to OptimizedResultsPanel and UnifiedPipelineProgress components

- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Circular timer updates: 500ms interval (vs 100ms previous) for smoother performance
  - useMemo hooks for expensive calculations (velocity, remaining time, stage colors)
  - React.memo for CircularCountdownTimer to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - SVG animations use CSS transitions (hardware accelerated)

- **Bundle Size Impact**:
  - Custom circular timer: ~2 kB (vs 15-20 kB for react-circular-progressbar)
  - Countdown utilities: ~1 kB
  - Total impact: ~3 kB for entire countdown system
  - No external dependencies added

### Documentation
