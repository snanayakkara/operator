  "transcript": "Emergency PCI for STEMI complicated by cardiogenic shock. Coronary angiography revealed total occlusion of the proximal LAD with TIMI 0 flow. Multiple attempts at wire passage required due to heavy thrombus burden. Aspiration thrombectomy performed prior to balloon angioplasty. Two overlapping drug-eluting stents deployed to cover the entire lesion. Final result showed TIMI 2 flow with residual stenosis of 20%. Patient required intra-aortic balloon pump for haemodynamic support. Post-procedure echocardiography showed severe left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction of 25%. Transferred to intensive care unit for ongoing management.",
