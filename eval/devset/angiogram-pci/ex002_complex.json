  "transcript": "Diagnostic coronary angiography revealed triple vessel disease with 90% stenosis in the proximal LAD involving the diagonal branch, 75% stenosis in the mid RCA, and 85% stenosis in the distal circumflex artery. Left ventricular angiography showed anterior wall hypokinesis with ejection fraction estimated at 45%. PCI performed to the LAD lesion using a 3.0mm x 28mm drug-eluting stent following pre-dilatation with a 2.5mm balloon. Side branch protected with wire. Final angiography demonstrated excellent result with less than 10% residual stenosis and TIMI 3 flow. Patient remained haemodynamically stable throughout the procedure. Plan for staged PCI to remaining vessels pending clinical assessment.",
